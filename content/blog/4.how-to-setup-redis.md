For silky smooth transitions, it’s essential to be explicit about the properties you want to transition.

A common approach is to use the transition shorthand:

```ts [index.vue]
  export default () => {
    console.log('Code block')
  }
```

::the-title{id="the-content-of-the-card"}
The content of the card
::

The more properties we add, the longer and more tangled this transition becomes. Even with variables, there’s a high risk of defining a property, duration or easing value incorrectly.
```css [file.css]
.btn {
  transition:
    color 0.2s ease,
    background-color 0.2s ease,
    border-color 0.2s ease;
}
```

::the-title{id="the-content-of-the-card"}
The content of the card
::

Rather than repeating the same transition for each property, define it once with shorthand and compliment with transition-property:
```css
.btn {
  transition:
    color 0.2s ease,
    background-color 0.2s ease,
    border-color 0.2s ease;
}
```

::the-title{id="the-content-of-the-card"}
